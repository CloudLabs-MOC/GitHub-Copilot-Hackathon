# Challenge 5: Create Documentation Using GitHub Copilot - Solution Guide

## Task 1: Generate Documentation with Copilot

In this task, you'll utilize GitHub Copilot to generate markdown documentation for the backend application for the GitHub repository [Azure-Samples/azure-search-openai-demo](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/azure-search-openai-demo) and will also make use of GitHub Copilot features to generate comments for codes.

1. Open Visual Studio Code and clone the GitHub repository [Azure-Samples/azure-search-openai-demo](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/azure-search-openai-demo).

1. Navigate to the folder **C:\Users\azureuser\azure-search-openai-demo\app\backend** and create a new **README.md** file

1. On the empty README.md file click Ctrl+I to get Copilot Copilot Chat window and ask Copilot to generate a README.md file for the directory app/backend.

1. Navigate to the ***app/backend/requirements.txt*** file and browse through the requirements. 

   ![](../../media/backend-requirements.png)

1. Now select the entire file, right-click, and then select **Copilot** and **Generate Docs**.

1. Notice how the GitHub Copilot lists out all the requirements in the file at the beginning.

   ![](../../media/backend-requirements-list.png)

1. Navigate to ***app/backend/approaches/approach.py*** file. You will notice that there are no comments for either of the modules, functions, or classes.

1. Now select the entire file, right-click, and then select **Copilot** and **Editor Inline Chat**. Ask the GitHub Copilot to generate comments for the selected code.

1. Notice how the GitHub Copilot generates comments in the code.

## Task 2: Enhance and Refine Documentation

In this task, you'll enhance and refine your README.md documentation by utilizing the GitHub Copilot Suggestions feature.

1. Open your **README.md** file, which you saved in the previous task.

1. Select the entire documentation and click **Ctrl+Enter** to view suggestions provided by GitHub Copilot to enhance the documentation.

   ![](../../media/backend-readme-suggestions.png)

1. You'll find a number of suggestions for the selected document that will help you refine it.

1. Browse through the GitHub Copilot suggestions and **Accept** the best-suited suggestions.

## Task 3: Explore Various Documentation Styles

In this task, you'll explore the various styles of documentation that you can generate by utilizing GitHub Copilot.

1. In your VS Code, create a new file, right-click anywhere on the new file, and select **Copilot** and **Start Inline Chat**.

1. Ask the GitHub Copilot to generate markdown documentation to deploy a VNet in Azure and click **Accept**.

1. You'll notice that the GitHub Copilot has generated step-by-step markdown documentation to deploy a VNet in Azure.

   ```
   # Deploy a Virtual Network (VNet) in Azure

   ## Introduction
   In this guide, we will walk you through the steps to deploy a Virtual Network (VNet) in Azure. A VNet is a fundamental building block for any Azure infrastructure deployment, as it provides isolation and segmentation of resources.

   ## Prerequisites
   Before you begin, make sure you have the following:
   - An Azure subscription
   - Sufficient permissions to create resources in Azure
   
   ## Steps

   ### 1. Sign in to the Azure portal
   - Open a web browser and navigate to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com).
   - Sign in with your Azure account.

   ### 2. Create a new Virtual Network
   - In the Azure portal, click on the **Create a resource** button.
   - Search for "Virtual Network" and select **Virtual Network** from the search results.
   - Click on the **Create** button to start the creation process.

   ### 3. Configure the Virtual Network
   - Provide a **Name** for the Virtual Network.
   - Select the appropriate **Subscription**.
   - Choose a **Resource group** or create a new one.
   - Select the **Region** where you want to deploy the Virtual Network.
   - Configure the **Address space** for the Virtual Network.
   - Optionally, configure the **Subnets** within the Virtual Network.
   - Click on the **Review + create** button to proceed.

   ### 4. Review and create the Virtual Network
   - Review the configuration settings for the Virtual Network.
   - Click on the **Create** button to start the deployment process.
   
   ### 5. Monitor the deployment
   - Once the deployment is initiated, you can monitor the progress in the Azure portal.
   - Wait for the deployment to complete.

   ## Conclusion
   Congratulations! You have successfully deployed a Virtual Network in Azure. You can now start using the Virtual Network to host your    Azure resources.

   ## Next Steps
   - Connect the Virtual Network to other Azure resources.
   - Configure network security and routing within the Virtual Network.
   - Explore advanced networking features in Azure.
   ```

1. You can also utilize GitHub Copilot Chat to generate a Javadoc to create a calculator.

   ```
   /**
    * This class represents a calculator that can perform basic arithmetic operations.
    */
   public class Calculator {
    
       /**
        * Adds two numbers and returns the result.
        *
        * @param num1 The first number.
        * @param num2 The second number.
        * @return The sum of the two numbers.
        */
       public int add(int num1, int num2) {
           return num1 + num2;
       }
    
       /**
        * Subtracts two numbers and returns the result.
        *
        * @param num1 The first number.
        * @param num2 The second number.
        * @return The difference between the two numbers.
        */
       public int subtract(int num1, int num2) {
           return num1 - num2;
       }
    
       /**
        * Multiplies two numbers and returns the result.
        *
        * @param num1 The first number.
        * @param num2 The second number.
        * @return The product of the two numbers.
        */
       public int multiply(int num1, int num2) {
           return num1 * num2;
       }
    
       /**
        * Divides two numbers and returns the result.
        *
        * @param num1 The first number.
        * @param num2 The second number.
        * @return The quotient of the two numbers.
        * @throws ArithmeticException if the second number is zero.
        */
       public double divide(int num1, int num2) {
           if (num2 == 0) {
               throw new ArithmeticException("Cannot divide by zero");
           }
           return (double) num1 / num2;
       }
   }
   /**
    * Performs multiplication for three variables or numbers.
    *
    * @param a The first number.
    * @param b The second number.
    * @param c The third number.
    * @return The result of multiplying the three numbers.
    */
   public int multiply(int a, int b, int c) {
       return a * b * c;
   }
   ```
   
## Conclusion

In this challenge, you've utilized GitHub Copilot to generate comments and markdown documentation for the backend app through GitHub Copilot features. You have also enhanced and refined your newly generated markdown documentation for the backend app through GitHub Copilot Suggestions. Further, you explored the various documentation styles that GitHub Copilot provides by generating markdown documents to deploy a VNet in Azure and a Javadoc to create a calculator from scratch.
