# Task 3: Develop and Test Features

### Utilize GitHub Copilot Chat for Feature Development:
  
   - Click on the "View" option on the top panel of Visual Studio. From the options, select "GitHub Copilot Chat" to open the GitHub Copilot Chat window.
  
        ![](../../media/crud3.5.png)

### Ask GitHub Copilot Chat for Feature Implementation:
   
   - Initiate a conversation with GitHub Copilot Chat by asking, "How can we add a search feature/functionality to our application?"

        ![](../../media/crud4.1.png)

   - Based on the response generated by GitHub Copilot, proceed with implementing the suggested code.
  
   - In this case, GitHub Copilot suggested adding a new method to accept a search string as a parameter and filter the user list based on the search string before passing it to the view.

        ![](../../media/crud4.2.png)
  
   - Copy and paste the provided code snippet into the `UserController.cs` file within the appropriate action method, typically the `Index` method. In this code, if a searchString is provided, the user list is filtered to only include users whose names contain the searchString. If no searchString is provided, all users are returned.

        ```
        // GET: User
        public ActionResult Index(string searchString)
        {
            var users = from u in userlist
                        select u;
            if (!String.IsNullOrEmpty(searchString))
            {
                users = users.Where(s => s.Name.Contains(searchString));
            }
            return View(users.ToList());
        }
        ```

        ![](../../media/crud4.3.png)

   - GitHub Copilot also suggested modifying the `Index.cshtml` file located in the path **Views\User\Index.cshtml** to include a form for the search string.

        ![](../../media/crud4.4.png)

   - Copy and paste the provided code snippet into the `Index.cshtml` file. This form sends a GET request to the Index action method, passing the search string as a query string parameter.

        ```
        @using (Html.BeginForm("Index", "User", FormMethod.Get))
        {
            <p>
                Find by name: @Html.TextBox("searchString") 
                <input type="submit" value="Search" />
            </p>
        }
        ```

        ![](../../media/crud4.5.png)

### Save Changes and Run the Application:

   - Save both the `UserController.cs` and `Index.cshtml` files after making the necessary changes.

   - Run the application by clicking on the IIS Express button. This action starts the application on localhost in a web browser.

        ![](../../media/crud1.6.png)

### Test the Search Functionality:

   - Add a couple of contact entries to the application by clicking on the "Create New" button and filling in the Name and Email fields.

        ![](../../media/crud4.6.png)

   - Once contacts are added, test the search functionality by typing a contact name in the search field that was previously added. Click on the "Search" button to execute the search.

        ![](../../media/crud4.7.png)

   - If the feature was implemented properly, you should be able to see the searched contact in the results.

        ![](../../media/crud4.8.png)

By following these steps, you can effectively utilize GitHub Copilot to implement and test new features in your application, enhancing its functionality and usability.

# Task 4: Generating Commit Messages

The new Generated Commit Message feature uses GitHub Copilot AI to describe your code changes.  This makes writing descriptive and helpful commit messages as easy as clicking a button, and then adding your explanation.

- Locate the Git Changes and click on it.

    ![](../../media/crud5.1.png)

- Use the new “Add AI Generated Commit Message” sparkle pen icon in the Git Changes window to generate a suggestion.

    ![](../../media/crud5.2.png)

- GitHub Copilot will look at the file changes in your commit, summarize them, and then describe each change. You can then “Insert AI Suggestion” or “Discard.” Click on Commit All.

    ![](../../media/crud5.3.png)

- Once it is committed locally, click on Push to push the changes into the repository.
