# Challenge 5: Create Documentation using GitHub Copilot

### Estimated Time: 45 minutes

## Introduction

**Contoso Ltd.**, a leading software development company, is working on a significant software development project. You have previously developed an application that integrates several complex features and functionality. However, the project lacks comprehensive documentation, making it difficult for new team members to understand the code and contribute effectively. The project leads recognize this issue and decide to leverage GitHub Copilot to generate documentation and make the project more accessible and maintainable.

In this challenge, you, as a developer at **Contoso Ltd.**, will leverage **GitHub Copilot** to expedite the creation of documentation for a given project or codebase. Documentation plays a crucial role in facilitating understanding, collaboration, and maintenance of software projects. By using Copilot's code generation capabilities, you'll explore how it can assist in creating descriptive and informative documentation. You will also review the generated documentation, refining and customizing it to suit the specific requirements of the project and ensure that the documentation provides clear explanations, usage instructions, and any other relevant details that would be helpful to developers.

By the end of this exercise, you will have a well-documented project that can be easily understood and maintained by other developers at **Contoso Ltd**. This scenario illustrates how **GitHub Copilot** can expedite and simplify the documentation process, thereby improving the efficiency and maintainability of software projects.

## Prerequisites

- GitHub repo [Azure-Samples/azure-search-openai-demo](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/azure-search-openai-demo) cloned in your environment.

## Challenge Objectives:

1. **Generate Documentation with Copilot:**
   - Utilize GitHub Copilot chat to generate a markdown documentation for the **backend** app and copy the documentation in a new file **README.md**.
   - Make use of GitHub Copilot Generate Docs feature to list out the requirements in the *app/backend/requirements.txt* file.
   - Generate comments for *app/backend/approaches/approach.py* file through GitHub Copilot Inline Chat.

2. **Enhance and Refine Documentation:**
   - Enhance the **README.md** markdown documentation generated in the previous challenge utilizing GitHub Copilot Suggestions.
   - Use the appropriate suggestions which will refine the documentation.

3. **Explore Various Documentation Styles:**
   - Utilize GitHub Copilot to generate a Javadoc to create a calculator.
   - Make use of GitHub Copilot to generate a markdown documentation to deploy a VNet in Azure.

## Success Criteria:

- Verify that the markdown documentation for the backend app is generated successfully using GitHub Copilot chat
- Verify that the requirements needed for the backend app are listed in the beginning of the *app/backend/requirements.txt* file by using GitHub Copilot Generate Docs feature.
- Verify that the comments are generated for the *app/backend/approaches/approach.py* file through GitHub Copilot Inline Chat.
- Make sure that the README.md documentation is enhanced and refined through GitHub Copilot Suggestions.
- Explore on various documentation styles that GitHub Copilot provides.
