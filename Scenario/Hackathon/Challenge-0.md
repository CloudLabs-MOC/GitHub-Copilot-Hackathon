### Enabling GitHub Copilot Enterprise

To enable users to use Copilot Enterprise features, your GitHub Enterprise Cloud enterprise must have a subscription to Copilot Enterprise.

Access to Copilot is determined at the enterprise and organization levels:

- Enterprise owners can allow some or all of the organizations in the enterprise to access Copilot.
- Owners of organizations that have been granted access to Copilot can assign GitHub Copilot Enterprise seats to some or all members of their organization. 

When access to Copilot has been enabled, features such as the ability to use Copilot on GitHub.com, can be configured. Features are enabled or disabled at the enterprise or organization level:

- Enterprise owners can set Copilot features to be enabled or disabled for all organizations in the enterprise that have access to Copilot. Alternatively, they can allow each organization to set its own policy for each feature.
- If the enterprise owner has permitted it, organization owners can enable or disable Copilot features for their organization.
