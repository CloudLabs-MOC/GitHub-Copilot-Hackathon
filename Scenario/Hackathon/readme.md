## Introduction

In this hackathon, you'll be delving into the functionalities of GitHub Copilot, an AI-powered coding assistant developed by GitHub in collaboration with OpenAI. Copilot is designed to assist developers in writing code faster and with greater efficiency. Throughout the challenges, you'll explore various aspects of Copilot, from setup and usage to code generation, refactoring, debugging, and even creating documentation.

## Learning Objectives

By participating in this hackathon, you will:

- Learn how AI can assist in code completion, suggesting patterns, and improving productivity.
- Understand how GitHub Copilot generates code snippets based on context and inferred intentions.
- Experiment with advanced use cases such as generating complex algorithms, refactoring codebases, or exploring new programming paradigms.
- Learn to approach and solve real-world problems through challenge-based tasks.

## Hackathon Format: Challenge Based
This hackathon adopts a challenge-based format, offering you a unique opportunity to learn while dealing with practical problems. Each challenge includes one or more self-contained tasks designed to test and enhance your skills and problem solving using GitHub Copilot. You will approach these challenges by:

- Analyzing the problem statement.
- Strategizing your approach to find the most effective solution.
- Leveraging the provided lab environment and GitHub Copilot extensions/tools.
- Collaborating with peers to refine and implement your solutions.
