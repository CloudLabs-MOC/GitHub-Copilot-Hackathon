# Challenge 3: Deploy the App to Azure

### Estimated Time: 90 minutes

## Introduction

In the previous challenge, you successfully developed a fully functional **Contact Database application**, developed mainly with the assistance of **GitHub Copilot** and also gained valuable insights into how AI can be seamlessly integrated into the development workflow.

As a software developer at **Contoso Ltd.**, a leading software development company, in this challenge, you are tasked with exploring innovative technologies and tools that can enhance the company's software development process and infrastructure management. **Contoso Ltd.** recognizes the potential of Infrastructure as Code (IaC) in managing and provisioning its computing resources and is particularly interested in Azure Resource Manager (ARM) templates for deploying applications to Azure.

In this challenge, you will utilize **GitHub Copilot** to streamline the development of an **Azure Resource Manager (ARM)** template. ARM templates are Infrastructure as Code (IaC) files used to deploy and manage resources in Azure. By leveraging Copilot's code generation capabilities, you'll expedite the creation of an ARM template for deploying an application to Azure. In addition to this, you will also automate the build and testing process of your code. You will create a GitHub Actions pipeline, with GitHub Copilot assisting in generating the necessary scripts. To document the knowledge and insights gained from this exercise, you will use **GitHub Copilot** to generate comprehensive and accurate documentation for this challenge. This documentation will serve as a guide for creating the ARM template, setting up the GitHub Actions pipeline, and deploying the application to Azure.

By completing this challenge, you aim to demonstrate to Contoso Ltd. how **GitHub Copilot** can streamline the development of ARM templates, automate build and testing processes with GitHub Actions, and generate insightful documentation. This will further highlight the value of integrating AI into the development workflow, following the successful development of the Contact Database application in the previous challenge.

## Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following from the CloudLabs provided integrated environment:

> **Note**: Pre-requisites are already set-up in the CloudLabs provided environment. If you're using your personal computer or laptop, please make sure that all necessary prerequisites are installed to complete this Hackathon.

- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
- [GitHub account](https://github.com/)
- [GitHub Copilot extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=GitHub.copilot) installed in VS Code.

## Challenge Objectives:

1. **Develop ARM Template to deploy an app to Azure:**
   - Use GitHub Copilot to assist you in generating the initial structure of an ARM template for deploying an application to Azure.
   - Define the necessary Azure resources such as App Service and any other components required for your application.

2. **Create GitHub Actions Pipeline with Copilot**
   - Create a GitHub Actions pipeline using GitHub Copilot to automate the build and testing process of your code using Copilot-generated scripts. 

4. **Generate Documentation with Copilot:**
   - Use GitHub Copilot to assist you in generating a detailed and accurate documentation specifically for this challenge.
   - Create a MD file which guides in creating the ARM template to deploy the app, create GitHub actions pipeline and getting the app working on Azure.

6. **Get the app working on Azure.**
   - Deploy the application to Azure using the ARM template you've created.
   - Verify that the deployed resources match the specifications outlined in your ARM template.
     
## Success Criteria:

- Verify that your chosen piece of code is refactored successfully, with improved readability and overall quality.
- Verify that a piece of code with intentional errors is fixed successfully using Copilot's suggestions.

## Additional Instructions:

- Refer [here](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/developer/github/deploy-to-azure) for additional help.
- If you encounter any challenges or have questions, refer to the [GitHub Copilot Documentation](https://github.com/github/copilot-docs) for guidance.

## Conclusion

In this challenge, you've experienced the power of GitHub Copilot in assisting with code refactoring and debugging tasks. By leveraging Copilot's suggestions, you've not only enhanced the quality of your code but also efficiently addressed code issues. As you continue your coding journey, remember to integrate these learnings into your regular development practices for more effective and error-free coding.
