# Challenge 3: Deploy the App to Azure  

### Estimated Time: ?

## Introduction

In this challenge, you will utilize GitHub Copilot to streamline the development of an Azure Resource Manager (ARM) template. ARM templates are Infrastructure as Code (IaC) files used to deploy and manage resources in Azure. By leveraging Copilot's code generation capabilities, you'll expedite the creation of an ARM template for deploying an application to Azure.

## Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following from the CloudLabs provided integrated environment:

> **Note**: Pre-requisites are already set-up in the CloudLabs provided environment. If you're using your personal computer or laptop, please make sure that all necessary prerequisites are installed to complete this Hackathon.

- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
- [GitHub account](https://github.com/)
- [GitHub Copilot extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=GitHub.copilot) installed in VS Code.

## Challenge Objectives:

1. **Develop ARM Template to deploy an app to Azure:**
   - Use GitHub Copilot to assist you in generating the initial structure of an ARM template for deploying an application to Azure.
   - Define the necessary Azure resources such as App Service and any other components required for your application.

2. **Create GitHub Actions Pipeline with Copilot**
   - Create a GitHub Actions pipeline using GitHub Copilot to automate the build and testing process of your code using Copilot-generated scripts. 

4. **Generate Documentation with Copilot:**
   - Use GitHub Copilot to assist you in generating a detailed and accurate documentation specifically for this challenge.
   - Create a MD file which guides in creating the ARM template to deploy the app, create GitHub actions pipeline and getting the app working on Azure.

6. **Get the app working on Azure.**
   - Deploy the application to Azure using the ARM template you've created.
   - Verify that the deployed resources match the specifications outlined in your ARM template.
     
## Success Criteria:

- Successfully refactor a chosen piece of code, improving its readability and overall quality.
- Successfully fix a piece of code with intentional errors using Copilot's suggestions.

## Additional Instructions:

- Feel free to explore additional refactoring techniques beyond the provided tasks.
- Experiment with different debugging scenarios to understand Copilot's capabilities in identifying and fixing code issues.
- If you encounter any challenges or have questions, refer to the [GitHub Copilot Documentation](https://github.com/github/copilot-docs) for guidance.

## Conclusion

In this challenge, you've experienced the power of GitHub Copilot in assisting with code refactoring and debugging tasks. By leveraging Copilot's suggestions, you've not only enhanced the quality of your code but also efficiently addressed code issues. As you continue your coding journey, remember to integrate these learnings into your regular development practices for more effective and error-free coding.

Happy coding!
