## Challenge Objectives  
1. **Develop an App:** 

      - Navigate to the below provided link and fork the repository in to the CloudLabs provided GitHub account.

      ```
      https://github.com/CloudLabsAI-Azure/CloudLabs-CRUD-application
      ```
      - Clone the forked Repository in to Visual Studio using the CloudLabs provided GitHub account.

      - The skeleton of the application has been set up, leaving the `UserController.cs` file with empty methods. Your task is to complete these methods by utilizing GitHub Copilot to generate the necessary code, guided by the comments provided in the file.

      - Explore Copilot's ability to understand your context and provide relevant code suggestions.  

      - Test the application thoroughly and ensure all functionalities work as expected

1. **Develop and Test Features:** 

      - Once the methods are completed, the next step is to develop the required features for the application and test them thoroughly.

      - Utilize GitHub Copilot to generate code snippets for building essential features

      - Test the application and make necessary modifications based on Copilot's suggestions.

1. **Use GitHub Copilot at each stage of the challenge:** 

      - Use GitHub Copilot to assist in writing meaningful commit messages that clearly describe the changes made.

      - Throughout the development process, engage with Copilot Chat to enhance collaboration and receive insightful coding recommendations.

      - Use GitHub Copilot to generate test cases for your application.
  
## Success Criteria  

- Verify that the methods in the `UserController.cs` file are completed successfully using GitHub Copilot.  
- Verify that the developed features are working as expected.  
- Verify that all the test cases are passed.
