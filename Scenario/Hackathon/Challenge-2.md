## Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following from the CloudLabs provided integrated environment:

> **Note**: Pre-requisites are already set-up in the CloudLabs provided environment. If you're using your personal computer or laptop, please make sure that all necessary prerequisites are installed to complete this Hackathon.

- Basic understanding of C# programming language.  
- A GitHub account.  
- GitHub Copilot installed on your Visual Studio.  
  
## Challenge Objectives  
1. **Develop an App:** 

      - Navigate to the below provided link and fork the repository in to the CloudLabs provided GitHub account.

      ```
      https://github.com/CloudLabsAI-Azure/Contact-Database-Application
      ```
      - Clone the forked Repository in to Visual Studio using the CloudLabs provided GitHub account.

      - You will be creating an application named **Contact Database Application**, a C# application, with the help of **Github Copilot**, which will let the users save the contact details of people as per requirements, and also carry out the basic functioning like editing their details, deleting their profiles and so. You will be provided with the skeleton of the application already, but will need to build the functionalities inside **UserController.cs** file by yourself. Your task is to complete these methods by utilizing GitHub Copilot to generate the necessary code, guided by the comments provided in the file.

      - Explore Copilot's ability to understand your context and provide relevant code suggestions.  

      - Test the application thoroughly and ensure all functionalities work as expected

1. **Develop and Test Features:** 

      - Once the methods are completed, the next step is to develop the required features for the application and test them thoroughly.

      - Utilize GitHub Copilot to generate code snippets for building essential features

      - Test the application and make necessary modifications based on Copilot's suggestions.

1. **Use GitHub Copilot at each stage of the challenge:** 

      - Use GitHub Copilot to assist in writing meaningful commit messages that clearly describe the changes made.

      - Throughout the development process, engage with Copilot Chat to enhance collaboration and receive insightful coding recommendations.

      - Use GitHub Copilot to generate test cases for your application.
  
## Success Criteria  

- Verify that the methods in the `UserController.cs` file are completed successfully using GitHub Copilot.  
- Verify that the developed features are working as expected.  
- Verify that all the test cases generated by Copilot are passed.  
- Make sure to successfully utilize GitHub Copilot to write commit messages.
