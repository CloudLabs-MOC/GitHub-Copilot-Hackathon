# Hackathon Mission and Use-Case

The mission of this hackathon is to understand the features and benefits of GitHub Copilot, an AI-powered coding assistant, and learn how to use it effectively to improve coding productivity, enhance code security, and streamline the software development process. You will work on various challenges to gain hands-on experience with GitHub Copilot in a variety of contexts, including setting up the tool, using it for code generation and suggestions, developing an application, deploying the app to Azure, and generating documentation and scripts. The ultimate goal is to leverage the power of AI in coding to create a satisfying work experience and develop a high-quality application.

Contoso, a software development company, is looking for ways to improve the efficiency and quality of its coding process. They have been facing challenges with coding productivity, code security, and time-consuming tasks such as documentation generation and script writing. Contoso decided to participate in this hackathon to learn about GitHub Copilot and understand how it can help overcome these challenges.

Your mission as a developer at Contoso is to work on different challenges during the hackathon. You can start by understanding the GitHub Copilot tool, setting it up in your coding environment, and exploring its various features, such as code autocompletion, context-aware suggestions, and code generation. You will develop a C# application named **Contact Database Application** with the help of **GitHub Copilot**,  starting from an existing application skeleton. In this application, you will be able to perform **CRUD** operations, that is, create, read, update, and delete operations. The app will allow you to perform these operations by creating, editing, and deleting users and maintaining a history of them. With the help of Copilot, you can complete the methods, develop and test essential features, and create a workspace. Copilot's code generation capabilities create an Azure Resource Manager (ARM) template, which you can use to deploy the application to Azure. You can also use Copilot to assist in creating a GitHub Actions pipeline. You will be exploring and utilizing advanced features of GitHub Copilot, such as workspace, file reference, and the advanced context window. Copilot helps generate documentation for the generated code and create scripts for the projects.

Through this hackathon, Contoso aims to leverage the power of AI in coding to improve coding productivity, enhance code security, and streamline the software development process. We count on you to ideate and build applications that can:

1. **Code Generation**: A developer can use GitHub Copilot to generate code snippets in various languages, such as Python, Java, JavaScript, etc. This can speed up the development process and reduce the time spent on boilerplate code.
2. **Code Review Assistance**: GitHub Copilot can be used to assist in code reviews. It can suggest improvements, point out errors, and help understand complex code snippets.
3. **Learning New Languages**: If a developer is learning a new programming language, GitHub Copilot can help by providing examples and suggestions in that language.
4. **Testing**: A developer can use GitHub Copilot to generate test cases for their code. It can suggest a variety of edge cases that the developer might not have thought of.
5. **Documentation**: GitHub Copilot can generate comments and documentation for existing code. This can help improve the clarity and maintainability of the code.
6. **Bug Fixing**: If a developer encounters a bug, they can use GitHub Copilot to suggest possible fixes. This can help speed up the debugging process.
7. **Project Setups**: When setting up a new project, GitHub Copilot can suggest the necessary configuration and setup code. This can save time and reduce the risk of errors.
8. **Data Analysis**: Data scientists can use GitHub Copilot to generate code for data analysis tasks, such as loading data, visualizing data, and building models.
9. **Code Optimization**: GitHub Copilot can suggest more efficient ways of writing code, helping developers optimize their applications.
10. **Algorithm Implementation**: GitHub Copilot can suggest implementations for various algorithms, saving developers the time of researching and implementing these algorithms themselves.

In this hackathon, you will interact with cutting-edge technologies crucial for achieving Contoso's vision. You will have access to all the necessary tools and resources to effectively realize these use cases.
