# Hackathon Mission and Use-Case

The mission of this Hackathon is to understand the features and benefits of GitHub Copilot, an AI-powered coding assistant, and learn how to use it effectively to improve coding productivity, enhance code security, and streamline the software development process. You will work on various challenges to gain hands-on experience with GitHub Copilot in a variety of contexts, including setting up the tool, using it for code generation and suggestions, developing an application, deploying the app to Azure, and generating documentation and scripts. The ultimate goal is to leverage the power of AI in coding to create a satisfying work experience and develop a high-quality application.

Use-Case Scenario: Contoso

Contoso, a software development company, is looking for ways to improve the efficiency and quality of its coding process. They have been facing challenges with coding productivity, code security, and time-consuming tasks such as documentation generation and script writing. Contoso decides to participate in this Hackathon to learn about GitHub Copilot and understand how it can help in overcoming these challenges.

Your mission as a developer at Contoso is to work on different challenges during the Hackathon. You can start by understanding the GitHub Copilot tool and setting it up in your coding environment and explore its various features such as code autocompletion, context-aware suggestions, and code generation. You can use Copilot to develop a C# application, starting from an existing application skeleton. With the help of Copilot, you can complete the methods, develop and test essential features, and create a workspace. Copilot's code generation capabilities to create an Azure Resource Manager (ARM) template, which you can use to deploy the application to Azure. You can also use Copilot to assist in creating a GitHub Actions pipeline. You will be exploring and utilizing advanced features of GitHub Copilot, such as workspace, file reference, and the advanced context window. Copilot helps to generate documentation for the generated code and create scripts for the projects.

Through this Hackathon, Contoso aims to leverage the power of AI in coding to improve coding productivity, enhance code security, and streamline the software development process. We count on you to ideate and build applications that can:

1. **Integration and Setup of GitHub Copilot**
   - Effortlessly configure GitHub Copilot in Visual Studio Code and log in with your GitHub account. Explore its integration with GitHub Codespaces and gain hands-on experience in various coding scenarios.

2. **Code Generation with Copilot**
   - Unlock the power of GitHub Copilot to generate code efficiently. Create a Python/JS-based code for a calculator and develop a Python/JSON-based app for retrieving weather data from APIs.

3. **Code Refactoring & Debugging**
   - Witness Copilot's intelligence in code refactoring. Use it to refactor a given piece of code and fix a code snippet with Copilot's assistance.

4. **ARM Template Development with Copilot**
   - Harness Copilot's capabilities in creating Azure Resource Manager (ARM) Templates. Utilize Copilot to generate an ARM Template for deploying an application to Azure.

5. **Documentation Creation with Copilot**
   - Explore Copilot's ability to assist in generating documentation for a project or codebase. Leverage its capabilities to streamline the documentation creation process.

In this hackathon, you will interact with cutting-edge technologies that are crucial for achieving Contoso's vision. You will have access to all necessary tools and resources to effectively realize these use-cases.
