      #A poorly written example of a program in Python. It prompts the user for the number of elements to sum, takes those integers as input, and handles some basic error cases
      
      MAX = 100

      def calculate_sum(arr):
         result = 0
         for num in arr:
            result += num
         return result

      def main():
         try:
            n = int(input("Enter the number of elements (1-100): "))
            if not 1 <= n <= MAX:
                  print("Invalid input. Please provide a digit ranging from 1 to 100.")
                  exit(1)

            arr = []

            print(f"Enter {n} integers:")
            for _ in range(n):
                  try:
                     arr.append(int(input()))
                  except ValueError:
                     print("Invalid input. Please enter valid integers.")
                     exit(1)

            total = calculate_sum(arr)

            print("Sum of the numbers:", total)

         except KeyboardInterrupt:
            print("\nProgram terminated by user.")
