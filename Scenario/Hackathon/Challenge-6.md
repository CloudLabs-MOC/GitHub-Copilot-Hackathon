# Challenge 6: Generate Scripts using GitHub Copilot

### Estimated Time: 60 minutes

## Introduction

At **Contoso Ltd.**, a leading software development company, you are given the task of exploring the capabilities of **GitHub Copilot**, an AI-powered coding assistant, and leveraging them in the company's software development process. The company believes that integrating AI into the development process can significantly enhance the efficiency and productivity of the development teams.

**Contoso Ltd.** is managing a large-scale infrastructure, which involves many repetitive tasks such as system monitoring, automation, configuration management, and more. To handle these tasks efficiently, the IT department has to create a considerable number of scripts. However, creating these scripts manually is time-consuming and prone to errors. You, as a system administrator at **Contoso Ltd.**, are tasked with automating these tasks using scripts. To make your job easier and more efficient, you decide to leverage **GitHub Copilot**, an AI-powered code completion tool, to generate the necessary scripts.

**GitHub Copilot** is an AI-powered code completion tool that assists Sysadmins in automating tasks and creating scripts efficiently. Leveraging machine learning, Copilot suggests context-aware code snippets, streamlining the process of writing sysadmin scripts. You will also use Copilot's debugging support to identify and resolve any issues present in the generated scripts, ensuring they work correctly. By the end of this challenge, you will not only automate a significant portion of your tasks but will also learn to create efficient scripts with the help of AI, greatly reducing the time and effort required.

## Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following from the CloudLabs-provided integrated environment:

> **Note**: Prerequisites are already set up in the CloudLabs provided environment. If you're using your personal computer or laptop, please make sure that all necessary prerequisites are installed to complete this hackathon.

- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
- [GitHub account](https://github.com/)
- [GitHub Copilot extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=GitHub.copilot) installed in VS Code.
- A **Linux VM** to execute the bash scripts and a **Windows VM** running (use your Windows Lab-VM to execute the PowerShell scripts).

## Challenge Objectives:

1. **Generate Sysadmin scripts:**
   - Generate a sysadmin resource monitoring bash script using GitHub Copilot for CPU and memory usage for a Linux VM.
   - Generate a sysadmin monitoring PowerShell script using GitHub Copilot for disk usage for a Windows VM.

2. **Refactor or debug the generated scripts:**
   - Apply Copilot's suggestions for code refactoring, leading to improved readability and maintainability of the scripts.
   - Effectively use Copilot's debugging support to identify and resolve any issues present in the generated scripts.

3. **Execute the scripts:**
   - Execute and test out the generated scripts in your environment, and view the results.

## Success Criteria:

- Verify that Sysdamin scripts for both Linux & Windows VMs are generated successfully using GitHub Copilot.
- Verify that the generated scripts are refactored or debugged successfully.
- Make sure the scripts are executed successfully, and the results are verified.

### Challenge Validation
