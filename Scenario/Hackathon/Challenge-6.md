# Challenge 6: Generate Scripts using GitHub Copilot

### Estimated Time: 60 minutes

## Introduction

At **Contoso Ltd.**, a leading software development company, you are given the task to explore the capabilities of **GitHub Copilot**, an AI-powered coding assistant, and leverage it in the company's software development process. The company believes that integrating AI in the development process can significantly enhance the efficiency and productivity of the development teams.

**Contoso Ltd.** is managing a large-scale infrastructure, which involves many repetitive tasks such as system monitoring, automation, configuration management, and more. To handle these tasks efficiently, the IT department has to create a considerable number of scripts. However, creating these scripts manually is time-consuming and prone to errors. You, as a System admin at **Contoso Ltd.**, are tasked with automating these tasks using scripts. To make your job easier and more efficient, you decide to leverage **GitHub Copilot**, an AI-powered code completion tool, to generate the necessary scripts.

**GitHub Copilot** is an AI-powered code completion tool that assists sysadmins in automating tasks and creating scripts efficiently. Leveraging machine learning, Copilot suggests context-aware code snippets, streamlining the process of writing sysadmin scripts. You will lso use Copilot's debugging support to identify and resolve any issues present in the generated scripts, ensuring they work correctly. By the end of this challenge, you will not only automate a significant portion of your tasks, but will also learn to create efficient scripts with the help of AI, greatly reducing the time and effort required.

## Prerequisites
